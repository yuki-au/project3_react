# Match 

## Introduction 

>This web application “match” is a shopping website aims at women that sells items collated by category list the user creates. 
Each user creates a category list as they register and log-in. Category list contains multiple categories. In this prototype, I created unique categories which represent moods such as “cheerful”, “mysterious”, “Energistics”, “Peaceful” and more. 
This feeling category aims to make users who are not looking for specific things narrow down their potential needs by their current mood category.
